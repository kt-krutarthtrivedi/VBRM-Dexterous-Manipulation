# VBRM-Dexterous-Manipulation

The aim is to perform dexterous in-hand manipulation using a parallel-jaw gripper.

## Problem Statement:

Consider the simplified model of the gripper as shown in the figure below. The object diameter is 0.03m; each gripper finger is equal length and 0.05m. The very tip points of the fingers are in touch with the object. The line that connects the contact points go through the origin of the object.
The goal is to get the object to the target location with the same orientation to the starting pose in less than 2 seconds. Thus, using in-hand dexterous manipulation, calculate the required gripper angles for the same.
